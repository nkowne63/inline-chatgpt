3. Open command pallet, select `BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing`
4. Paste copied URL into the opened dialogue.
5. Press `Add Plugin` button.

## How to use

1. choose `New dialogue` in the command-palette. Therefore, the dialogue area appears there.
2. That is all. Now, it is time to chat!

## Memo
- The dialogue is saved as a code block. We can resume the conversation anytime we want.
- Also, they are searchable.
- Long consultation consumes many tokens. If the dialogue gets longer, starting a brand-new one is recommended.
